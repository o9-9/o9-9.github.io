### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Googly%20Eyes&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some other menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender or Ice if you have it installed.

#### Why is it using a lot of CPU?

The app is optimized as much as possible, but macOS is inefficient at updating menu bar items. Also, make sure you know how to [interpret CPU usage](/apps/faq#high-cpu).
